## Description
I was motivated to complete this project to demostrate the importance of test/jest applications.
The reason for this assignment was to practice working with OOP.
This project aims to help with the tedious task of data entry in a work setting.
I learned how to properly use tests to examine the content of my code. 


## Installation
To install this application the user can type the name of the application into their search engine. The user then answers the questions regarding their co-workers/employees and their data will populate into easy-to-read contact cards. 

## Usage
An employer can use this application for an easy/accessible way to access their employee/co-workers information. 

## Credits
I would like to thank my instructor, T.A., and my tutor for helping me with this project. I also used W3 Schools and Educative.io for futher understanding.
